2021년도 2학기 소프트웨어설계 강의에서 프로젝트로 제작한, 오픈소스 Jitsi Meet의 커스텀 홈페이지입니다.
해당 강의는 오픈소스 회의방을 이용해 실제로 서비스가 가능한 웹서비스를 제작하는 것이 목표였습니다.

저희 팀은 대학생 멘토와 멘티가 자유롭게 만나서 소통할 수 있는 공간을 만들기 위해 M2M 웹서비스를 제작하였습니다.
해당 프로젝트는 수업 기간 중 구글 클라우드서버와 파이어베이스를 이용해 접속할 수 있도록 개방하였습니다.
주 기능은 멘토와 멘티가 서로 만날 수 있는 "방 개설" 기능과 서로간에 메시지를 전달할 수 있는 채팅 기능입니다.

## Running your own instance

If you'd like to run your own Jitsi Meet installation head over to the [handbook](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-start) to get started.

We provide Debian packages and a comprehensive Docker setup to make deployments as simple as possible.
Advanced users also have the possibility of building all the components from source.

You can check the latest releases [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/releases).

## Jitsi as a Service

If you like the branding capabilities of running your own instance but you'd like
to avoid dealing with the complexity of monitoring, scaling and updates, JaaS might be
for you.

[8x8 Jitsi as a Service (JaaS)](https://jaas.8x8.vc) is an enterprise-ready video meeting platform that allows developers, organizations and businesses to easily build and deploy video solutions. With Jitsi as a Service we now give you all the power of Jitsi running on our global platform so you can focus on building secure and branded video experiences.
